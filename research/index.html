	<h1>Augmenting Modern Software Systems

<!--
Superprogrammers have tapped out. 
Everyday programmers—the rest of us—are 
-->
<strong>I build systems that transform other systems.</strong>
My systems lift the capabilities of programmers called upon to deal with the complexity of modern software systems.
They automate <em>away</em> inessential complexity and automate <em>in</em> desired features — securing programs that use hundreds of software dependencies, bolting distribution onto existing applications, and parallelizing large-scale pipelines built out of multi-language components.
I characterize the behavior of my systems using real workloads seen in practice, often paired with mathematical models and proofs of key properties of interest.

          <h2>Automating Protections Against Software Supply-Chain Threats</h2>

          <p>
            Modern software incorporates thousands of dependencies as a means of accelerating its development and reducing its cost—at a significant risk to safety and security for both developers and end-users.
           We have built a series of systems targeting the JavaScript dependency ecosystem—the largest such ecosystem out there—automating the analysis, transformation, and synthesis of dependencies across a variety of threat models.

<strong>Papers:</strong>
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/breakapp:plos:2017.pdf">PLOS17 paper</a> highlights the problem with third-party libraries.
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/breakapp:ndss:2018.pdf">NDSS18 paper</a> proposes automated transformations that use operating-system protection mechanisms to isolate selected libraries.
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/lya:fse:2021.pdf">FSE21 paper</a> proposes language-based instrumentation techniques applied to the context around each library, offering Turing-complete analysis and protection at a reduced runtime cost.
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/mir:ccs:2021.pdf">CCS21a paper</a> proposes a RWX permission model applied at the library boundary, combined with static and load-time program analysis that automates permission inference.
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/harp:ccs:2021.pdf">CCS21b paper</a> uses active learning and regeneration to synthesize vulnerability-free replacement libraries that fall under certain computational domains.
Ongoing research 
  (i) develops the model behind library recontextualization and its proofs of soundness properties, and 
  (ii) develops techniques for protecting against memory-unsafe native addons, such as ones written in C/C++ or available in binary.

          <h2>Automating Shell Script Parallelization/Distribution</h2>

          <p>
					Shell scripting is used pervasively, <!--especially by non-expert programmers,--> 
            partly due to its simplicity in combining components (commands) written in multiple languages.
<!--ranging from binary executables to interpreted scripts to virtually any command available in a computer!-->
					Unfortunately, this language-agnostic composition hinders automated parallelization and distribution, often forcing developers to manually rewrite shell programs (and their components) in other languages that support these features.
          We have several projects that, combined, offer automated parallelization (and, soon, distribution) of Unix/Linux shell scripts—along with serious correctness and compatibility guarantees.

          <h2>Automated Transformation Towards Secure Scalable Computing Paradigms</h2>
          <p>
            Recent trends are pushing developers towards new paradigms of secure and scalable computing—<em>e.g.</em>, confidential computing, microservices, serverless computing, edge computing, <em>etc</em>.
            Transforming a conventional program to leverage these paradigms is a laborious manual process that can lead to suboptimal performance and in many cases even break the program.
            We are developing systems supporting this kind of decomposition, often leveraging special hardware capabilities when possible.
            </p>
<p>
<strong>Papers:</strong>
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/ignis:pldi:2019.pdf">PLDI paper</a> presents a module-level decomposition, resource awareness, and scale-out of bottlenecked components.
Our <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/ar:edgesys:2018.pdf">EdgeSys</a>, <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/ar:apsys:2018.pdf">APSys</a>, and 
<a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/p/tmc:apnet:2019.pdf">APNet</a> papers describe several components of this vision.
Ongoing work tackles
  (i) automated application decomposition of monolithic applications towards confidential computing, and
  (ii) automated application decomposition of monolithic applications towards microservice and serverless computing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Software:</strong>
Atlas (<a href="https://github.com/atlas-runtime">GitHub</a>) is a new runtime environment that support seamless offloading and scale-out, including over Trusted Execution Environments such as Intel SGX.
Atlas forms the basis upon which we build a lot of our distributed infrastructure.
